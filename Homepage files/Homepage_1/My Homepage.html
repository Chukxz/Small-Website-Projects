                <li>Special Relativity is compatible with Quantum Mechanics but General Relativity is not&period;
                </li>
                <li>In Einstein&apos;s General Relativity Field equations&comma; the left side of the equation that describes the curvature of Space&dash;time does not have a Quantum Mechanical operator while the right side does have and so the left side
                    cannot equal the right side &lbbrk;note that equality is required in any equation&rbbrk; because curvature is not at least currently quantitized while the stress&dash;energy and momentum tensors are quantitized&period; Although the
                    equation didn&apos;t have a QM operator when Einstein formulated it&comma; it was later added due to the fact that the properties of matter on the right side of the equation were quantitized and this showed that General Relativity
                    is currently incompatible with Quantum Mechanics due to the fact that the operators on the right side are not real numbers and as a result of this cannot be equal to the real numbers on the left side of the equation&period;
                </li>
                <li>General Relativity describes Gravity so well but a theory of Gravity at the Quantum scales or in other words Quantum Gravity is as of now unverifiable as there is no equipment that is currently able to test if Gravity is quantitized and
                    if so&comma; how it is quantized&period; This is due to the fact that Gravity is so weak compared to the other forces and there is no equipment that can measure the effects of such an extremely weak force on atomic and sub&dash;atomic
                    particles accurately&comma; reliably&comma; precisely and without interference from other Quantum phenomena&period; Ideal conditions for measuring Gravity occur in extremely hostile environments like massive stars and most preferably
                    black holes in which the force of Gravity is sufficiently strong or is even the strongest as in the case of black holes and it&apos;s effects are dominant on the Quantum scale&period;
                </li>
                <li>Another conflict arises from the fact that Quantum Mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute while General Relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and ductile&period;
