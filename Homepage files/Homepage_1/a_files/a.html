            <ul class="firstlist">

                <li>A lot of work is yet to be done in the field of gravity owing to the fact that there is currently no mathematical equation that unifies Quantum Mechanics and Gravity.
                </li>
                <li>Special Relativity is compatible with Quantum Mechanics but General Relativity is not.
                </li>
                <li>In Einstein's General Relativity Field equations, the left side of the equation that describes the curvature of Space‐time does not have a Quantum Mechanical operator while the right side does have and so the left side cannot equal the
                    right side ❲note that equality is required in any equation❳ because curvature is not at least currently quantitized while the stress‐energy and momentum tensors are quantitized. Although the equation didn't have a QM operator when
                    Einstein formulated it, it was later added due to the fact that the properties of matter on the right side of the equation were quantitized and this showed that General Relativity is currently incompatible with Quantum Mechanics due
                    to the fact that the operators on the right side are not real numbers and as a result of this cannot be equal to the real numbers on the left side of the equation.
                </li>
                <li>General Relativity describes Gravity so well but a theory of Gravity at the Quantum scales or in other words Quantum Gravity is as of now unverifiable as there is no equipment that is currently able to test if Gravity is quantitized and
                    if so, how it is quantized. This is due to the fact that Gravity is so weak compared to the other forces and there is no equipment that can measure the effects of such an extremely weak force on atomic and sub‐atomic particles accurately,
                    reliably, precisely and without interference from other Quantum phenomena. Ideal conditions for measuring Gravity occur in extremely hostile environments like massive stars and most preferably black holes in which the force of Gravity
                    is sufficiently strong or is even the strongest as in the case of black holes and it's effects are dominant on the Quantum scale.
                </li>
                <li>Another conflict arises from the fact that Quantum Mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute while General Relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and ductile.

        General Relativity:

                    in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's laws of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four‐dimensional spacetime.
                    In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential
                    equations.

        Newtonian Gravity:        
    </span>Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional
                    to the square of the distance between their centers. The publication of the theory has become known as the “first great unification”, as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known
                    astronomical behaviors. In physics, the special theory of relativity. or special relativity for short. is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein's original treatment, the theory is
                    based on two postulates:

            Quantum Field Theory:
    </span> In theoretical physics, quantum field theory ❲QFT❳ is a theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity and quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models
                    of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles,<br> QFT treats particles as excited states ❲also called quanta❳ of their underlying quantum fields, which are more fundamental than the particles.
                    Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in the Lagrangian involving their corresponding quantum fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by Feynman diagrams according to perturbation theory in
                    quantum mechanics.

        Quantum Field Theory In Curved Spacetime:
    </span> In theoretical physics, quantum field theory in curved spacetime ❲QFTCS❳ is an extension of quantum field theory from Minkowski spacetime to a general curved spacetime. This theory treats spacetime as a fixed, classical
                    background. while giving a quantum‐mechanical description of the matter and energy propagating through that spacetime. A general prediction of this theory is that particles can be created by time‐dependent gravitational fields ❲multigraviton
                    pair production❳, or by time‐independent gravitational fields that contain horizons. The most famous example of the latter is the phenomenon of Hawking radiation emitted by black holes.

        Quantum Gravity:
    </span> Quantum gravity ❲QG❳ is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics, and where quantum effects cannot be ignored, such as in the vicinity of black holes
                    or similar compact astrophysical objects, and where the effects of gravity are strong, such as in neutron stars.<br> Three of the four fundamental forces of physics are described within the framework of quantum mechanics and quantum
                    field theory. The current understanding of the fourth force, gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the entirely different framework of classical physics. However, that description
                    is incomplete: describing the gravitational field of a black hole in the general theory of relativity leads physical quantities, such as the spacetime curvature, to diverge at the center of the black hole.

            </ul>

            <p class="note1 ">Just as Galilean relativity is now accepted to be an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds, special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields, that
                is, at a sufficiently small scale ❲e.g., when tidal forces are negligible❳ and in conditions of free fall. General relativity, however, incorporates non‐Euclidean geometry in order to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature
                of spacetime, Special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as Minkowski space. As long as the universe can be modeled as a pseudo‐Riemannian manifold, a Lorentz‐invariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined
                for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point in this curved spacetime.
