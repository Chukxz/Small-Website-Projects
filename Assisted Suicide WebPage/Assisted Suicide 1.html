                <p>Assisted suicide is not a new thing&period; It started with the <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_with_Dignity_National_Center">Death with Dignity Act</a></span> or <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16">
                    Measure 16&comma; of 1994</a></span>&period; This Act was a citizen&apos;s lead initiative by <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Coombs_Lee">Barbara Coombs Lee</a></span> a nurse&comma; lawyer and the
                    chief petitioner of <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16">
                    Measure 16</a></span>&period; And <span class="dwda"><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-goodwin-death-with-dignity_b_1368253">Dr&period; Peter Goodwin</a></span> a family practitioner and professor who drafted the measure&period;
                    We all know that suicide is the ending of one&apos;s life&period; but assisted suicide is more distinctive&period; assisted suicide is the help provided by a doctor by the request of a patient&comma; to end his or her life&period;
                </p>
                <p>With that being said&comma; assisted suicide is often grouped together with <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia">euthanasia</a></span> under MAiD &lbbrk;Medical&dash;aid&dash;in dying&rbbrk;&period; However
                    they do not mean the same thing as <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"> euthanasia </a></span>is deliberately ending a person&apos;s life to relieve suffering&comma; while assisted suicide is suicide
                    effected with the assistance of another person&comma; especially the taking of lethal drugs provided by a doctor for the purpose by a patient suffering from a terminal illness or incurable condition&period; There are different views
                    on assisted suicide&period; The question of whether assisted suicide should be legal or not depends on public opinion&period; One may be tempted to ask why assisted suicide should exist in the first place&period; It is no wonder evidence
                    suggests that the desire to hasten death often comes from wanting to maintain some power over one&apos;s life&period;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition&comma; supporters of assisted suicide believe that patients on the verge of dying should be allowed to die with dignity&period; They claim that patients that are terminally ill should be allowed the right of choosing how they die&period; As
                    choosing the right to assisted suicide would be the final exercise of autonomy for the dying&period; Contrary to their belief&comma; the opposers believe that allowing assisted suicide devalues human life and violates certain religious
                    and spiritual beliefs&period; They insinuate that legalising assisted suicide by attempting to establish an absolute right to bodily autonomy may undermine the importance and value of human life and humans as a whole&period; Also if
                    a case of assisted suicide occurs in a country&comma; state&comma; province&comma; region&comma; or place where it has not been legalized then the doctor may be arrested&period; The patient may not also be in his or or her right mind
                    and with further encouragement may change his or her mind&period;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that there exists some moral&comma; ethnic&comma; religious&comma; and social contemplations on the issue&comma; some countries have legalised assisted suicide&period; The countries which have legalised assisted suicide include Austria&comma;
                    Belgium&comma; Canada&comma; Germany&comma; Luxembourg&comma; the Netherlands&comma; New Zealand&comma; Spain&comma; Switzerland&comma; parts of the USA &lbbrk;ten states and the District of Columbia&rbbrk; and parts of Australia &lbbrk;all
                    the states except New South Wales&rbbrk;&period;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary&comma; assisted suicide should be legal in the eyes of some as long as the patients have access to their autonomy&comma; that is&comma; their cognitive functions are working properly otherwise it will be a case of
                    <span class="dwda"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia">euthanasia</a></span>&period; But in other people&apos;s opinions&comma; it should be discouraged&period;
